<p>Explore These Materials:
1. Read (45 min) — Piaget on play (short excerpt); Seymour Papert, Mindstorms (intro on learning through making).<br />
2. Watch (45 min) — Playful learning: MIT Media Lab projects; Game design and flow (short talk).<br />
3. Listen (30 min) — Jane McGonigal on games and motivation (podcast clip).<br />
4. Observe — Notice how you explore when stakes are low vs high; list behaviors that signal curiosity vs fear.</p>

<li>Playground Prototyping — Build 3 tiny prototypes that encourage exploration (paper, tape, simple materials); test each for 5 minutes.  </li>
<li>Rule Twist — Take a familiar game; change one rule to emphasize learning a skill (memory, estimation, balance); test with a friend.  </li>
<li>Debrief Notes — Capture what participants did first, when they got stuck, and what made them laugh or try again.  </li>
<li>Reflection — Define “serious play” for your own practice; where will you use it this semester?</li>

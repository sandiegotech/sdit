<h2 id="session-overview">Session Overview</h2>
<p>This first session is your introduction to the soul of SDIT.</p>
<p>You’re not here to memorize facts. You’re here to explore meaning — through reading, conversation, philosophy, reflection, and creative expression. Today’s work is about tuning your internal compass. What is education? What is it for? What kind of learner — and person — do you want to become?</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>By the end of this session, you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a personal definition of &ldquo;education&rdquo;</li>
<li>Compare classical and modern critiques of the university</li>
<li>Visually map your worldview and how education fits into it</li>
<li>Reflect on who you&rsquo;re becoming through this process</li>
</ul>

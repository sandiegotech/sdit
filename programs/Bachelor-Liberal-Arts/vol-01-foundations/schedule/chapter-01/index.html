<hr />
<h2 id="orientation">Orientation</h2>
<p>Every education begins with a question. This chapter opens the door not to content, but to consciousness. You’ll explore five core modes of inquiry—liberal learning, storytelling, mathematical reasoning, scientific observation, and creative cognition—each a different lens for seeing the world and yourself within it.</p>
<p>This isn’t about absorbing information. It’s about changing the way you pay attention. The goal is not mastery—it’s awakening. You’re beginning to build a personal archive of insight, to tune your perception, and to develop the tools to ask sharper questions.</p>

<li>What are the hidden patterns of thought and nature?</li>
<li>How do stories, numbers, observations, and ideas reveal structure and meaning?</li>
<li>How do I learn to think in a way that’s rigorous, imaginative, and alive?</li>
</ul>

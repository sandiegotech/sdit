<p>Explore These Materials:
1. Read (45 min) — Plato, Allegory of the Cave (Republic, Book VII, excerpts); Nietzsche, On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense (excerpt).<br />
2. Watch (45 min) — Allegory of the Cave explained (short lecture); Relativism vs Realism (overview).<br />
3. Listen (30 min) — Philosophy Bites: Truth and Relativism (podcast segment).<br />
4. Reflect While Engaging — As you read/watch/listen, list claims that changed when the perspective shifted (author, culture, method).</p>

<li>Perspective Grid — Pick a contemporary question (e.g., AI risk, nutrition, justice). Write the central claim from three perspectives (scientific, philosophical, personal). Note what counts as evidence for each.  </li>
<li>Cave, Recast — Rewrite Plato’s cave in a modern setting (news feeds, algorithms, subcultures). Who are the prisoners, shadows, fire, and sun?  </li>
<li>Claim/Evidence/Ambiguity — Take one strong claim you hold. List the best evidence for and against it, plus what you don’t know yet.  </li>
<li>Reflection — When does “it depends” (relativism) help us think better, and when does it excuse sloppy reasoning?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="hard-problem-optional">Hard Problem (Optional)</h2>
<p>Choose one theory of truth (correspondence, coherence, or pragmatic). Defend it with a concrete case study, and explain how the other two theories would handle the same case.</p>

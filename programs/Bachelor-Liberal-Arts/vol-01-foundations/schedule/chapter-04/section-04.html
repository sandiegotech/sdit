<h2 id="learning-session">Learning Session</h2>
<p>Explore These Materials:
1. Read (45 min) — Work‑Energy theorem; Potential energy (gravitational and spring) — short primer.<br />
2. Watch (45 min) — Energy Skate Park (simulation overview); From forces to energy (lab demo).<br />
3. Listen (30 min) — Energy vs Power in everyday devices (short segment).<br />
4. Observe — Identify three daily activities and list the energy transformations (chemical → mechanical → thermal, etc.).</p>

<ol>
<li>Stair Climb — Estimate your work against gravity: measure mass, floors climbed, and compute mgh; discuss sources of error.  </li>
<li>Spring Test — Measure a spring constant k (weights and ruler); estimate energy 1/2 kx^2 at two extensions; compare to “feel.”  </li>
<li>Energy Accounting — Choose a system (pendulum, rolling ball). Describe energy transfers/losses (sound, heat, deformation) through a cycle.  </li>
<li>Reflection — Distinguish energy (capacity to do work) from power (rate). Where did you mistake one for the other this week?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="hard-problem-optional">Hard Problem (Optional)</h2>
<p>Two people carry the same load up the same height; one slowly, one quickly. Who does more work? Who expends more power? Where could total energy differ in practice?</p>

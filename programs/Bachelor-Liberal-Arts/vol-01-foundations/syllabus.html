  <h1 id="semester-overview">Semester Overview</h1>
<p>This first volume is about foundations: learning how to think clearly, communicate with purpose, see the world mathematically and scientifically, and explore creativity as a daily practice.</p>
<p>Across five courses, you will move between philosophy, writing, math, science, and creative exploration. The goal is not just to cover content, but to begin building the habits of a reflective learner — someone who can connect ideas across fields, ask better questions, and carry wisdom forward into life.</p>
<p>By the end of this semester, you will:
- Understand what a liberal education is and why it matters.
- Strengthen your ability to write, tell stories, and persuade.
- Explore mathematics not as memorization, but as a language of patterns.
- Learn how to observe the natural world through experiments and curiosity.
- Develop your creative intelligence through projects, sketches, and artifacts.</p>

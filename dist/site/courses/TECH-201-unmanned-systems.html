<h1 id="unmanned-systems-uas-fundamentals">Unmanned Systems — UAS Fundamentals</h1>
<h2 id="what-this-course-is-about">What This Course Is About</h2>
<p>This is a hands‑on introduction to unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). You’ll assemble, configure, and operate a small, modular platform while learning core systems: airframes, propulsion, power, avionics, radio links, and flight control. Emphasis on safety, spectrum awareness, methodical troubleshooting, and clear documentation.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<h2 id="why-it-matters">Why It Matters</h2>
<p>Safe, competent UAS work blends engineering judgment with disciplined operations. Understanding systems, spectrum, and procedures lets you build reliable platforms, fly responsibly, gather useful data, and communicate results that others can trust.</p>
<p>⸻</p>
<h2 id="course-goals">Course Goals</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Build and configure a modular UAS (airframe, power, avionics)
- Plan and conduct safe flight operations with sound checklists
- Explain radio links and spectrum basics; verify failsafe behavior
- Calibrate sensors and log telemetry; analyze basic flight data
- Communicate results via concise flight logs and short post‑flight reports</p>
